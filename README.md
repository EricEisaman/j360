This project shows how to export 4K resolution 360 Videos and Photos from inside of Three.js scenes.

Part of a process described at https://medium.com/p/788226f2c75f

Basically you take a cube camera, save it to equirectangular photo, and then stitch those together to make a video.  Add some metadata and voila! 

I have modified several of the libraries here to support taking 360 photos:
CCapture.js
CupemapToEquirectangular.js

Tested on Chrome, Windows x64
